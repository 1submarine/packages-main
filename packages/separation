description = An oh-my-fish theme for those who like the output of each 
              command to be clearly distinguishable from the rest. 
summary     = A theme which displays a horizontal bar across the terminal for
              each prompt, visually separating the output of each command.
              Displays return status (if not 0), username, hostname, and the
              working directory on the second line. If this string is longer
              than two fifths of the screen, the prompt is split into a third
              line, ensuring plenty of space to type commands.
